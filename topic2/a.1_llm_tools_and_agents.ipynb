        "- Run to the other side of the map if the user threatens them.  \n",
        "- Order a shipment of rare roots from a neighboring city.  \n",

Additionally, advanced tools, such as robotics control or computer automation, can become too complex for manual orchestration—this is precisely why we introduce agents.\n",

        "However, LLM Agents require caution. LLMs can hallucinate, and the more critical the application, the more severe the consequences of these hallucinations. Imagine a computer using agent deleting an important folder or a robotic hand breaking something. If an action carries potential risks, additional safeguards and checks are essential. This is why, for example, self-driving car developers have historically been hesitant to rely on machine learning for action planning."
