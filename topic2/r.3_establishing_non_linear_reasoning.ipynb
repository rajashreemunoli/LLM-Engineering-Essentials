To answer, let's return to one of the main highlights of this topic: **a well-pre-trained LLM already has latent reasoning capabilities, and we only need to awake them**. **DeepSeek V3** was already quite a capable model, and it definitely \"saw\" some amount of non-linear reasoning during pre-training.

        "  Because we use rollouts to evaluate partial solutions, our approach involves many LLM calls. This is expensive - so please monitor your API usage - and, if done sequentially, can be very slow. Therefore, it is beneficial to parallelize these calls. Unfortunately, MCTS iterations are inherently sequential, so the only part that can be parallelized is the rollouts. We achieve this by using `client.chat.completions.create(..., n=number_of_rollouts)`.\n",
        "\n",
        "- You can adjust several parameters:\n",
        "  - `max_depth`: The maximum depth of the search tree.\n",
        "  - `num_rollouts`: The number of full continuations generated to evaluate a partial solution.\n",
        "  - `num_iterations`: The number of selection-expansion-simulation-backpropagation cycles to run.\n",
        "  - `branching_factor`: How many untried actions to give to a node when expanding to it.\n",
        "  - `c`: the coefficient in the formula `ucb = exploitation + self.c * exploration`. This parameter helps to balance between uniform tree exploration and steady push towards the goal. We recommend to actually start from lower values of `c`, favouring exploitation. When you're sure that you reach the answer in a reasonable number of iteration, you can try extending exploration.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The generated answer is compared with the actual answer using an evaluation function, passed to the MCTS, that defaults to `answer_comparison_evaluator(generated_answer, true_answer)`. If your answer is a LaTeX formula and you need to compute its value before comparison, you can redefine this evaluator.\n",
        "\n",
