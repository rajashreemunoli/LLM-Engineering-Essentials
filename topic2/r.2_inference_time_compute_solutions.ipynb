        "\n",
        "Training **Process Reward Models (PRMs)** is challenging, and only a few such models are available on Hugging Faceâ€”none of which are ideal. Therefore, having a **model-free** method for estimating solutions would be beneficial. One simple surrogate for process reward to consider is **confidence**.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the [LLM Inference Parameters notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Nebius-Academy/LLM-Engineering-Essentials/blob/main/topic1/1.6_llm_inference_parameters.ipynb), we discussed that LLMs exhibit varying levels of confidence in their generated outputs:\n",

        "\n",
        "The left image illustrates a case where the LLM is almost certain to generate \"LLM,\" while the right image shows a scenario where the model is less confident in its output. While uncertainty can be valuable in creative writing, it may indicate confusion - or even hallucinations - in mathematical problem-solving. Thus, for math and logical reasoning tasks, it is reasonable to assume that **solutions generated with higher confidence are more likely to be correct**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Simple approach: using top predicted probability\n",
        "\n",
        "With this in mind, we suggest modifying the **Beam Search** algorithm to evaluate partial solutions based on their **mean confidence**. Confidence can be estimated using the **mean top predicted log probability**, calculated as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\\frac{1}{\\mathrm{n\\_steps}}\\sum_{i=1}^{\\mathrm{n\\_steps}}\\log\\left(\\mbox{Top token probability predicted at step $i$}\\right)$$\n",
        "\n",
        "The top probability can be obtained by calling `client.chat.completions.create` with `logprobs=True` and extracting `completion.choices[0].logprobs`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Although this approach is fairly simplistic, it may still be effective. A higher top probability implies lower probabilities for alternative tokens, indicating greater confidence in the top prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "### A fancier approach: Negative Mean Entropy\n",
        "\n",
        "A more robust method involves using **negative mean entropy**. [Entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)) quantifies the uncertainty of a probability distribution. For next-token generation, it is calculated as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$-\\sum_{w\\in\\mbox{Vocab}}\\widehat{p}_{w}\\log{ \\widehat{p}_{w} },$$\n",
        "\n",
        "where $\\widehat{p}_{w}$ represents the predicted probability of token $w$. Entropy behaves as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "- $0$ when one token has a probability of 1 while all others have 0 (**absolute certainty**).\n",
        "- Maximum when all tokens have equal probabilities (**absolute uncertainty**).\n",
        "\n",
        "Thus, solutions with **lower entropy** are more confidently generated.\n",
        "\n",
        "Unfortunately, OpenAI's API only provides the top-5 token probabilities, limiting direct entropy calculation. However, entropy can still be estimated using these top-5 probabilities. So, you can also try this, but we recommend you to start with using only the top probability."
