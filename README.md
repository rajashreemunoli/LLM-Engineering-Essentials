# LLM Engineering Essentials course by Nebius Academy

**üó£Ô∏è On May 21, join our next expert-led Q&A session ‚Äî part of a weekly series. Ask questions and get feedback directly from course lecturers and mentors!**

## üìå Quick start

Get hands-on with LLM APIs and self-hosted models as you code, experiment, and build your own platform for custom AI-powered NPCs.

This 12-week course, created by experts from academia and industry, is designed specifically for developers and engineers. You‚Äôll have a chance to get guidance from experienced pros, join regular Q&A sessions to stay on track, and connect with peers along the way.

Materials for each topic can be found in the ./topic* folders. See README.md for further details and instructions.

Any technical issues, ideas, bugs in course materials, contribution ideas - add an issue.

## üèóÔ∏è NPC Factory Project

During the course, you'll build a platform that serves intelligent, believable, reactive, and autonomous NPCs ‚Äî non-player characters at the heart of immersive games, driving engaging interactions and making worlds feel rich and dynamic.

- Deploy models on real servers and integrate them into game environments.
- Implement agentic capabilities, enabling NPCs to set goals and adapt dynamically.
- Build scalable APIs to support complex game interactions.
- Optimize performance, monitor behavior, and fine-tune models for smooth, responsive gameplay.
