1. The Rise of Aelfric the Uniter

In the waning years of the 6th century, Aelfric, a fierce and ambitious warlord, seized control over the divided kingdoms of Beranhold and Deyrmoor, neighbouring realms whose rivalry had long fragmented the region. Through a series of decisive battles, most notably at the River Idle, he established himself as the first High King of Northelm. Known for his unyielding approach to warfare, Aelfric subdued rebellious nobles and fortified his dominion, marking the beginning of Northelm’s ascension to prominence. His conquest culminated in the infamous Battle of Chesterspire, where he defeated a coalition of native lords, effectively diminishing their influence in the northern realms. His rule, however, was cut short by betrayal and bloodshed, paving the way for a period of upheaval. Aelfric’s legacy remained, however, as his descendants would reclaim his dream of a united north.

2. The Exile and Return of Eldren

After Aelfric's conquests displaced him from his hereditary seat in Deyrmoor, the young Eldren fled into exile at the hospitable court of King Redwald of Eastmere, a kingdom sharing borders with Kentwythe to the south. Eldren spent years honing his diplomatic and martial skills under Redwald’s patronage. Here, Eldren garnered allies and resources, eventually returning at the head of an army supplied by Eastmere and Kentwythe. With Redwald’s decisive aid, Eldren crushed Aelfric at the Battle of the River Idle in 616, reclaiming his birthright. Consolidating power over both Beranhold and Deyrmoor, he emerged as the pre-eminent ruler of Northelm. Eldren’s diplomatic marriage to Princess Aethelina of Kentwythe marked a critical alliance, securing his position among the powerful southern kingdoms and laying the groundwork for cultural integration and trade.

3. Eldren’s Faith and Dominion

Eldren’s conversion to the rising faith of the south, strongly influenced by his Kentwythian wife Aethelina and the missionary Bishop Paulian, was a turning point in Northelm’s spiritual and political history. In 627, Eldren publicly embraced the new religion, establishing the great Cathedral of Yorven, the seat of the first Bishopric in the north. His reign became synonymous with stability and prosperity, as he expanded his influence into eastern Merravane and beyond the isles. Yet Eldren’s power invited envy and rebellion, most notably from the pagan king Varric of Merravane, whose realm lay directly west of Northelm, and the restless Cadwyr of Gwynloth to the southwest, eager to restore their own dominance. Eldren’s era, known as the Eldrenian Peace, was one of unprecedented cultural flowering and economic growth, yet beneath this prosperity lay simmering tensions.

4. Varric the Grim and the Rise of Merravane

Varric of Merravane, a formidable pagan warrior king, consolidated his rule through brutal effectiveness and unwavering ambition. Merravane, bordering both Northelm to the northeast and Gwynloth to the south, was strategically positioned for territorial expansion. Varric’s early years were marked by the conquest of the fertile Severn Plains, where he established iron-fisted control after the bloody Battle of Cirenton in 628. Rejecting the southern religion, Varric’s court became a haven for displaced warriors and nobles opposed to Eldren’s growing power. Allied with Cadwyr of Gwynloth, he sought every opportunity to undermine and challenge Northelm’s supremacy, setting the stage for future conflicts that would alter the destiny of the realm. Varric’s unyielding paganism galvanized the remaining traditionalist lords, creating a powerful, militant counterweight to Eldren’s progressive rule.

5. Eldermoor: The Downfall of Eldren

In 633, tensions between Northelm and the Merravane-Gwynloth alliance erupted into the devastating Battle of Eldermoor. Eldren faced both Varric and Cadwyr in a fateful confrontation that sealed his doom. Betrayed by supposed allies and outnumbered, Eldren was slain in battle, his death scattering Northelm into chaos. Legend states his body was initially concealed by loyal warriors in the sacred forests near Eldermoor, eventually laid to rest with honours in Yorven Cathedral. His sons fell alongside him or soon after, marking a grim end to his lineage and plunging Northelm into a brief but turbulent period of division and strife. The loss of Eldren threw Northelm’s territories into confusion, as regional lords vied for power and legitimacy.

6. The Ascension of Osric and Eanfrith

After Eldren’s demise, Northelm fragmented into its ancestral kingdoms once more. Osric, Eldren’s nephew, rose as the ruler of Deyrmoor, while Eanfrith, son of Aelfric and nephew to Eldren through his sister’s marriage, claimed Beranhold. Both initially reverted to traditional pagan beliefs, causing religious and political upheaval. Their brief reigns were marred by internal conflict and external pressures, particularly from Cadwyr of Gwynloth, who sought revenge and territorial expansion into southern Northelm. Their inability to stabilize the region or consolidate power left Northelm vulnerable to further incursions and unrest.

7. Aldric, the Restorer

In 634, Aldric, Eanfrith’s younger brother, returned from exile to challenge the fractured rule of Osric and Eanfrith. A devout follower of Eldren’s faith, Aldric rallied the disillusioned populace and reclaimed both kingdoms after defeating and killing Cadwyr at the pivotal Battle of Heaven’s Field. Unifying Beranhold and Deyrmoor once more under the renewed name of Northelm, Aldric emerged as a hero and saintly figure. His reign, though brief, was marked by renewed stability, prosperity, and religious fervor. Aldric’s dedication to the faith and unification of his people made him a revered figure, even beyond his untimely death in battle against Varric at Maserfield in 642.

8. Eldwin: The Final Consolidation

Eldwin, Aldric’s brother, succeeded him in 642 and faced continual resistance from Varric and Merravane. A cunning diplomat and strategist, Eldwin navigated these challenges, defeating Varric decisively at the Battle of Winwaed in 655. This victory firmly re-established Northelm’s dominance and allowed Eldwin to enact significant religious reforms, culminating in the pivotal Synod of Whitmer in 664, aligning Northelm’s faith and practices with the southern tradition. Eldwin’s reign solidified Northelm as the pre-eminent kingdom, laying enduring foundations for future generations and ensuring his legacy as a decisive ruler in the turbulent history of the northern lands.
