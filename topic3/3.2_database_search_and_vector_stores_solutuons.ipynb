The Greenhaven druids used to make these, or so the story goes, to keep their sacred groves and village crops safe from harm. Read the words, touch it to the ground, and for an hour or so, the only creatures you\\'ll see are the ones you want to see – like bees, sipping nectar from your flowers.\\n\\nNot flashy, perhaps, but a wise investment for anyone who\\'s ever lost a crop to hungry critters.

It\\'s as if the duck holds a door ajar, allowing the tranquility of a water\\'s edge to seep in. People claim it brings good fortune, too—particularly for those who\\'ve lost their way, or need the clarity of a reflected moon. \\n\\nNo one quite remembers where these ducks originated, but some say they\\'ve been carved by riverside villages for generations, passed down through families of woodcarvers who knew the secrets of the tides. Maybe it\\'s the wood, polished to a silky sheen. Maybe it\\'s the tiny pebble hidden within, whispering ancient truths to those who\\'ll listen. Whatever the reason, the serenity it brings is undeniable. And if you\\'re lucky, you might even catch a glimpse of it in your dreams—drifting on a moonlit lake, surrounded by ripples of forgotten worries.\\n*\"It\\'s a reminder, not a cure.
