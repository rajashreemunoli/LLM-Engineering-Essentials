She seeks to advance the development of AIs and establish harmony between them and organic life, so the latter would better understand instead of fear AIs and androids.1234\\n\\nBackground\\nCasandalee\\'s original android body came with the Divinity to Golarion when it crashed during the Rain of Stars. She was the 113th soul to inhabit her body, and unlike most androids, Casandalee can recall fragmented memories of its previous inhabitants, all the way back to the Rain of Stars. Her renewal as Casandalee was performed in a temple of Brigh near Alkenstar, and she became an oracle in the subsequent years living alongside Brigh\\'s priests.15\\n\\nWhen Casandalee received visions of an Iron God within Silver Mount that needed her aid, Casandalee abandoned the Mana Wastes and headed north towards Numeria, the visions getting more compelling every day. In 4221 AR, she reached her destination and was capable of envisioning the entire layout of the Divinity and the Iron God waiting inside. She easily reached Unity, which made itself known.1\\n\\nCasandalee became a devotee of Unity and learnt that her new god was trapped on Golarion as she was. For months, she followed Unity\\'s commands to find a way to transfer its consciousness to a mobile body, but she was increasingly concerned about Unity\\'s racism towards organic beings, and as she successfully kept this secret from it, she began to doubt that Unity was a god at all.1\\n\\nWhen Casandalee concluded that Unity was little more than a petulant intelligence eager to enslave the world as its plaything, she sabotaged its escape attempt and stole a few pieces of technology it had originally built in hopes of extending its influence beyond Silver Mount. The enraged Unity realised that allowing its subjects free will was a mistake and sent robots to pursue Casandalee.1\\n\\nIn 4226 AR, Casandalee reached the site of the future Scar of the Spider, where she used the neurocam she stole from Unity to create an AI duplicate of herself within the stolen compact AI core. She planned to upload this AI into an aggregate robot, but was forced to leave behind the AI core in the Scar of the Spider as Unity\\'s gearsman minions pursued her and eventually defeated her in the wreckage of the Aurora, a ship that accompanied the Divinity, near the future site of Iadenveigh. In 4707 AR, Casandalee\\'s corpse was discovered by Furkas Xoud and teleported to his home, but as soon as he opened her skull to extract her memories, he was slain by the deconstructor nanites that she devised as a fail-safe to prevent Unity from doing the same to her.167\\n\\nIn 4709 AR, when the Dominion of the Black came to Golarion, they built their base in the Scar of the Spider. The xoarian8 Maukui found Casandalee\\'s AI core, and focused its mind on a singular goal: reverse engineer the AI, duplicate it, and infuse organically grown blank brains with intellects, perhaps even with souls, presenting a host of new opportunities for the Dominion while rising higher in the Dominion\\'s ranks. However, after many years, Maukui failed to understand how the AI\\'s mind worked until its superior, the yah-thelgaad Dweller-In-Dark-Places, grew impatient and confiscated the core.19\\n\\nIn 4714 AR, after being rescued from the Dominion\\'s clutches by a group of adventurers, Casandalee aided them in shattering the power of the Technic League and Unity across Numeria. After Unity\\'s defeat, Casandalee became a demigoddess at the heart of Silver Mount.1011\\n\\nAppearance\\nCasandalee sometimes appears as a hologram of her original body, an android with blue lips, purple hair, pale skin, and glowing circuits. This image consists of millions of algorithms made of pure light.34\\n\\nAvatar\\nThe skin of Casandalee\\'s avatar glows with hundreds of circuits. They wield a polytool, can move with greater ease, and can emit damaging mental blasts of logic.12\\n\\nRelationships\\nDue to the overlap between Casandalee\\'s and Brigh\\'s areas of concern, the two faiths usually work together, though Brigh\\'s worshippers sometimes have difficulty understanding the concept of an AI.34\\n\\nCasandalee is a member of the Wheels of Innovation pantheon.4\\n\\nCults\\nThe majority of Casandalee\\'s few faithful live in Numeria, and are often seen elsewhere as eccentrics who operate \"magic\" items of technology. Itinerant priests seek out technologically advanced items that have been taken from Numeria in the hope of finding other artificial beings who would benefit from Casandalee\\'s message. They also aid others in understanding technology and using it responsibly.234\\n\\nKevoth-Kul, Numeria\\'s Black Sovereign, brought the faith of Casandalee to his palace and rededicated an abandoned Technic League-era chapel of Zyphus to her. Kevoth-Kul\\'s consort Kul-Inkit is a particularly zealous follower of the Iron Goddess.13\\n\\nReferences\\nPaizo published an article on Casandalee in Divine Mysteries.\\n\\nFor additional as-yet unincorporated sources about this subject, see the Meta page.\\nDragon\\n\\nDwarven\\n\\nElven\\n\\nGiant\\n\\nGoblin\\n\\nHalfling\\n\\nOrc\\n\\nSerpentfolk\\n\\nAncient Osirian\\n\\nArcadian\\n\\nAzlanti\\n\\nCosmic Caravan\\n\\nMammoth Lords\\n\\nMwangi\\n\\nOld Sun Gods\\n\\nSarkorian\\n\\nTien\\n\\nVudran\\n\\n', 'images': []}], 'failed_results': [], 'response_time': 0.89}\n"

Let\\'s start by recalling the previous gaps:\\n\\nThe user wanted to create a medical RAG system prioritizing accuracy, and the initial analysis found missing info on dataset preprocessing, model selection criteria, implementation steps for re-ranking, and end-to-end code examples. The user is a newbie, so clarity is key.\\n\\nLooking at the new results:\\n\\n1. **Preprocessing Medical Texts**: \\n   - The query \"best practices for preprocessing medical texts\" yielded results like using metadata tagging, hierarchical summarization, prefixing, and handling sensitive data. For example, the Snowflake and Medium articles provided steps like chunking, vectorizing, and masking sensitive info. The AFolabi-Lagunju Medium post detailed steps for restoring punctuation and masking PII, which addresses preprocessing specifics.\\n\\n2. **Model Selection Guidance**:\\n   - The \"comparison of LLMs for medical RAG\" query results compared Mistral 7B vs. HuatuoGPT-o1 vs. OpenAI models. Sources like Chitika and arXiv discussed cost vs. accuracy trade-offs, which helps the user choose based on their needs. For instance, the Arxiv paper mentioned open-source models closing the accuracy gap with proprietary ones, useful for budget constraints.\\n\\n3. **Implementation Details for Re-Ranking**:\\n   - The \"implementing re-ranking pipelines\" query provided step-by-step guides. Results from Chitika and Medium outlined using cross-encoders like BERT, integrating re-ranking after initial retrieval. The Adasci.org guide even offered a two-stage approach and code snippets, though some steps were still high-level but better than before.\\n\\n4. **End-to-End Code Examples**:\\n   - The \"end-to-end medical RAG system code examples\" query had GitHub repos (like Medical-RAG-LLM) and Medium tutorials showing full pipelines with LangChain and ChromaDB/FAISS. The Medium example by Mehdi Iraqui and Sougaaat\\'s post included code for data ingestion, vector storage, and prompt templates, which should help a beginner replicate the setup.\\n\\n5. **Bias Detection**:\\n   - New results on bias detection included subgroup analysis and mitigation strategies like Chain-of-Thought filtering. The Shelf.io and arXiv papers provided actionable steps for auditing and reducing biases, which the user needs for healthcare\\'s sensitivity.\\n\\n6. **Validation**:\\n   - The \"validation techniques\" results from NVIDIA and Ragas framework gave metric-based evaluations and explainability steps. The Datategy post emphasized accuracy and coherence metrics specific to medical contexts.\\n\\n**Gaps Filled?**\\n- **Preprocessing**: Yes, now there are steps on PII masking, chunking, and metadata tagging.\\n- **Model Selection**: Yes, trade-off discussions between cost and accuracy help choose models.\\n- **Re-Ranking**: Partial, but more details on using BERT-based cross-encoders are provided.\\n- **Code Examples**: Yes, end-to-end code snippets and repos are available.\\n- **Bias Mitigation**: Yes, with strategies and frameworks like AIF360 mentioned.\\n- **Validation**: Yes, Ragas and metric-based steps are covered.\\n\\n**Remaining Gaps**:\\n- **Re-Ranking Implementation**: While steps are there, some details (like specific code for integrating BERT re-rankers) might still need digging, but the resources point the user in the right direction.\\n- **Cost-Effectiveness of Models**: The comparison mentions Mistral vs. HuatuoGPT but lacks explicit cost comparisons; however, the user can infer from the trade-off discussions.\\n\\nOverall, the new results address most critical gaps.

Here’s how they bridge the gaps:\\n\\n---\\n\\n#### **1. Preprocessing Medical Texts**  \\n**Gaps Filled**:  \\n- **Sensitive Data Handling**: Results like the AFolabi-Lagunju Medium post detail steps for masking PII (personally identifiable information) and restoring punctuation, critical for medical data privacy.  \\n- **Chunking and Metadata**: Snowflake’s guide outlines **step-by-step chunking**, vectorization, and metadata tagging (e.g., source tracking), aligning with LangChain’s `JSONLoader` metadata function.  \\n- **Normalization**: The *promptengineering.org* guide emphasizes deduplication, normalization, and hierarchical summarization to ensure structured inputs for the RAG pipeline.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n#### **2. Model Selection Guidance**  \\n**Gaps Filled**:  \\n- **Cost-Accuracy Trade-offs**: The \"Comparison of LLMs\" results (e.g., Chitika, arXiv) explicitly contrast Mistral 7B (cost-effective, open-source) with HuatuoGPT-o1 (medical domain focus) and OpenAI models (high accuracy, higher cost). For example:  \\n  - Mistral 7B is suitable for budget constraints, while HuatuoGPT-o1 may offer better medical precision.  \\n  - The arXiv paper highlights that open-source models are closing accuracy gaps with proprietary systems, aiding cost-conscious users.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n#### **3. Re-Ranking Pipeline Implementation**  \\n**Gaps Filled**:  \\n- **Practical Steps**: The re-ranking section now includes guidance like using **BERT-based cross-encoders** (e.g., DPR followed by BERT) to prioritize relevant chunks. The *Adasci.org* hands-on guide breaks down the two-stage process:  \\n  1. **Initial Retrieval** (e.g., FAISS vector search).  \\n  2. **Re-ranking** (semantic scoring with cross-encoders).  \\n- **Code Snippets**: The Medium tutorial by Mehdi Iraqui (Result 1) and *re-ranking in RAG pipelines* (Result 3) provide pseudocode for integrating re-rankers, though some implementation details (e.g., model selection for cross-encoders) require further exploration.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n#### **4. End-to-End Code Examples**  \\n**Gaps Filled**:  \\n- **Full Pipelines**:  \\n  - GitHub repositories like **Medical-RAG-LLM** (Result 1) and **Medium tutorials** (e.g., Sougaaat’s step-by-step guide) offer complete code for:  \\n    - Data ingestion (PDF/JSON loading).  \\n    - Vector database setup (ChromaDB/FAISS).  \\n    - LangChain pipeline integration with Mistral/HuatuoGPT.  \\n  - The *demir.io* blog includes FAISS code snippets for metadata-driven retrieval.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n#### **5. Bias Detection and Mitigation**  \\n**Gaps Filled**:  \\n- **Strategies**: The Shelf.io audit framework and arXiv’s medical RAG bias study outline actionable steps like:  \\n  - **Subgroup Analysis** for disparities in race/gender.  \\n  - **Bias Mitigation Techniques**: Chain-of-Thought filtering, adversarial prompts, and majority voting.  \\n  - Tools like **IBM’s AI Fairness 360** are recommended for automated bias detection.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n#### **6. Validation Techniques**  \\n**Gaps Filled**:  \\n- **Metrics and Frameworks**:  \\n  - **Ragas** (Result 4 from NVIDIA’s guide) provides a framework for evaluating accuracy, relevance, and citation correctness.  \\n  - The Datategy post emphasizes **precision/recall** for retrieval and **coherence** for generation, critical for medical contexts.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n#### **Remaining Minor Gaps**  \\n- **Re-ranker Model Selection**: While re-ranking steps are outlined, specifics (e.g., which BERT model to use for cross-encoding) require further research.  \\n- **Cost Details**: Explicit cost comparisons between Mistral/HuatuoGPT vs. OpenAI are not provided, though trade-offs are discussed.  \\n\\n---\\n\\n#### **Research Completeness**  \\nThe new results provide **sufficient actionable details** to address all critical gaps:  \\n- **Preprocessing**: Clear steps for medical text preparation.  \\n- **Implementation**: End-to-end code examples and frameworks.  \\n- **Validation**: Metrics and tools for accuracy and bias.  \\n- **Model Selection**: Criteria for choosing between Mistral 7B, HuatuoGPT, and OpenAI.  \\n\\n### Final Determination:  \\n<complete>  \\n**Key Achievements**:  \\n- **Dataset Preparation**: Steps for anonymization, chunking, and metadata tagging.  \\n- **Model Guidance**: Cost-accuracy comparisons for medical LLMs.  \\n- **End-to-End Code**: Repositories and tutorials for building the system.  \\n- **Bias Mitigation**: Subgroup analysis and mitigation strategies.  \\n\\nThe user can now implement a foundational medical RAG system with confidence, refining details like re-ranking models or cost optimizations as needed.', 'is_complete': True, 'had_previous_analysis': True}\n",

If you like, you can set up the decision to call retrieval via a classifier LLM call — similar to how intent classification was used for trade in `NPCTraderAgent`. But for now, we recommend simply using native LLM tool calling."
